# Advanced-Triplanar-Shader
In this section, we're gonna learn about triplanar and how to use it in a Unity shader graph. So first, what is Triplanar? It's a method of generating UVs and sampling a texture by projecting it into the world space. This way, we're not sampling the texture based on the game object itself.
